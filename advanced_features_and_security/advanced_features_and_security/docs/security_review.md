# Django Security Review: HTTPS and Secure Headers

## üîê Settings.py Summary

- **SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT**: Redirects all HTTP to HTTPS.
- **HSTS Settings**: Enforces long-term HTTPS usage (1 year preload, includes subdomains).
- **Secure Cookies**: Session and CSRF cookies only sent via HTTPS.
- **Headers**:
  - `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = DENY` protects from clickjacking.
  - `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` blocks MIME sniffing.
  - `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` enables XSS filtering in browsers.

## üåç Nginx Config

- Redirects port 80 (HTTP) to 443 (HTTPS).
- Proxies HTTPS requests to local Django server on port 8000.
- Uses Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates.

## üß† Security Analysis

These settings:
- Prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks via HTTPS.
- Block most basic XSS, sniffing, and iframe exploits.
- Ensure cookies aren't exposed to insecure connections.

**Future Improvements:**
- Add `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header.
- Use `django-csp` or `whitenoise` for secure static file delivery.
- Setup automatic cert renewal (`certbot renew --dry-run`).
